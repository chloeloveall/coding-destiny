## Description

_Second independent Epicodus project that creates an application with questions to determine users first programming language._<br><br>
_**Note to Epicodus Instructors (01/15/2021):** As discussed with Leilani, I am having a difficult time grasping JavaScript. I was unable to accomplish much on my project due to this. I spent most of the day reviewing the week's lessons, working on the practice exercises I did not undertstand, and completing other JavaScript tutorials and exercises that are applicable to this project (on edabit.com, theodinproject.com, and codecademy.com)_
